## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

You need to run three processes simultaneously in separate terminals.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *(From the `backend` directory)*
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    *(From the `frontend` directory)*
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Start the Inngest Dev Server:**
    *(From the `backend` directory)*
    This command explicitly connects the dev server to your backend API.
    ```bash
    npx inngest-cli dev -u http://localhost:5001/api/inngest
    ```

-   Your application will be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or your Vite port).
-   The Inngest Dev Server dashboard will be at `http://localhost:8288`.
